# Recipe Run Log

Human-readable history for recipe-driven work.

Use this file to record what was run, what worked, what failed, and what should
be tested next. Keep entries short. Do not include secrets, real phone numbers,
private emails, or sensitive application notes.

## 2026-06-12 — Wrote Tutorial 00 (Exercise Zero) in full

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v3, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` schema, MYCROFT.md attestation rules
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/00-personal-layer.md` — privacy-first setup (gitignore gate), paste-ready agent prompt (3 tasks with hard stops), resume.json schema with evidence fields and attested timestamp, full 8-question conditional intake tree (visa block only after a "no" at Q4), gaps draft with 3 required student edits (kill a row / rewrite a row / write one startable plan), migration rule, 4 exercises (delete test, inflation hunt, multi-model SOC second opinion, six-hour test), what-can-go-wrong table; index updated to ready
- **Result:** Exercise Zero runnable today in Claude Code with zero new scripts. Extraction-corrections count gives each student a personal fluency-vs-truth measurement on day one.
- **Open issues:** SOC matching quality from free text untested against real student answers; the agent prompt should be re-tested once the config generator lands (Tutorial 01 hand-edit note then changes); per-section attestation flags deliberately omitted in favor of one file-level timestamp — revisit if students attest carelessly.

## 2026-06-12 — Dropped personas for conditional intake; added gaps file + Exercise Zero

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: don't invent personas, ask for relevant facts — past for resume, future for wants/constraints; generate an editable gaps file; gaps migrate to resume with evidence; this is the first exercise)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v3, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (skill_*_lv / ability_*_lv columns)
- **Outputs:** design doc revised — personas replaced by conditional intake over canonical fields (question tree branches on answers, no labels); new gaps-file section (generated draft from O*NET levels + scanned-posting keyword frequency, human-owned thereafter, regenerate-as-diff, migration-to-resume.json only with evidence); Exercise Zero defined; tutorials index gains Tutorial 00 (planned)
- **Result:** Personal layer is three files with distinct epistemic status: resume.json (attested past), profile.yml (declared future), gaps.md (managed delta). Aspirational resume entries become structurally impossible. Engine extends from application allocator to development allocator (gaps = what to build in the six hours).
- **Open issues:** gap computation quality unknown until tried against a real resume + SOC pair; Tutorial 00 not yet written; intake question tree not yet drafted.

## 2026-06-12 — Added profile metadata + personas to the design

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: resume facts ≠ search metadata; US citizens shouldn't see visa questions; start with a few personas, add later)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v2
- **Outputs:** new "Profile metadata" section — four starting personas (international student, US new grad, employed-and-quietly-looking, flexible/part-time); two-layer model: canonical profile fields + personas as intake routing/defaults only; scorer weights become a function of profile fields (sponsorship weight ≈ 0 for citizens, timeline gate persona-conditional)
- **Result:** Persona proliferation avoided — combinations are field combinations, not new personas; engine reads fields, never labels. New-persona criterion is evidence-driven (recurring intake combinations the presets serve badly).
- **Open issues:** discretion mechanics for the employed persona (employer-affiliate exclusion list source?); whether persona presets live in data/ as a versioned file (recommended) or in the intake recipe prose.

## 2026-06-12 — Revised profile design: roles-first intake + resume.json layer

- **Recipe:** manual (human design input: never ask for companies; ask what they want to do → SOC codes → suggest companies; resume converted to verified JSON, generated docs derive from it)
- **Inputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` v1, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv`, `scripts/resumes/`
- **Outputs:** design doc revised — 5-step pipeline (intake → SOC resolution with human confirmation gate → generate → review/prune → scan); new resume.json section (upload → extract → field-by-field human attestation → all resume artifacts generated as projections, never rewrites); search/ layout extended; course-project mapping section (student H-1B probability tools and resume-JSON converters are the engine's missing components)
- **Result:** Companies are now an output of the engine, not an input. Resume claims become machine-checkable against attested source fields — verified-data contract extended to the student's own history.
- **Open issues:** unchanged 4 open decisions + new: JSON Resume schema as-is vs extended; where extraction-hallucination checking lives (conformance script vs gate checklist).

## 2026-06-12 — Designed profile-driven config generation

- **Recipe:** manual (triggered by human design question: why does a human hand-edit portals.yml?)
- **Inputs:** `recipes/_profile.template.md`, `scripts/ats/detect-ats.py`, `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (alternate_titles columns), `data/80-days-to-stay/`, `scripts/ats/scan.mjs` (REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS env var)
- **Outputs:** `docs/search-profile-design.md` (intake → search/profile.yml → generated portals.yml with O*NET + curated synonym expansion, evidence-derived company suggestions, gitignored personal `search/` folder); Tutorial 01 Step 1 reframed (hand-editing = looking under the hood, not steady state)
- **Result:** Design connects four existing-but-disconnected pieces: profile template, detect-ats.py, O*NET alternate titles, sponsorship data. Human reads/judges generated config; never writes it.
- **Open issues:** Generator script, synonyms seed file, profile recipe, and `.gitignore` entry not yet built — design awaits approval on 4 open decisions (folder name, intake form, suggestion cap, fate of personal files in data/ats/).

## 2026-06-12 — Verified Greenhouse API liveness; fixed tutorial browser-check step

- **Recipe:** manual (triggered by human observation: `job-boards.greenhouse.io/databricks` redirects to the company careers site; same pattern at Duolingo)
- **Inputs:** `scripts/ats/providers/greenhouse.mjs` (read: provider derives `boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>/jobs` and fetches with `redirect: 'error'`); fetched the Databricks and Duolingo API endpoints directly
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/01-first-scan.md` Step 6 rewritten (verify against the API JSON, not the board page, with explanation of the redirect pattern); new what-can-go-wrong row
- **Result:** Both APIs live and serving: Databricks ≈97 KB payload, 100+ postings; Duolingo ≈78 KB, ≈80 postings. The browser redirect is a UI relocation, not an API removal — human-facing board pages increasingly redirect to branded careers sites while the JSON API keeps serving. Scanner unaffected by design (API-only + redirect:'error'). This partially closes the prior open issue "provider fetch not verified": the endpoint is confirmed reachable and serving from this environment's fetch tool, though still not via the scanner process itself.
- **Open issues:** Job counts are approximate (counted from match listings, not a parsed total). If Greenhouse ever moves or gates boards-api, the provider fails loudly (`fetch failed` / redirect error) — correct behavior, but worth a tutorial-02 liveness note. Some companies may genuinely leave Greenhouse; a redirected board page plus a 404 from boards-api is the signature of that case.

## 2026-06-12 — Added tutorials layer (docs/tutorials/)

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/ats/portals.example.yml`, `scripts/ats/scan.mjs` (usage header, flags, default paths), `package.json`, MYCROFT.md conventions
- **Outputs:** `docs/tutorials/01-first-scan.md` (full predict→run→inspect→judge→record walkthrough with 6 graduated exercises and a what-can-go-wrong table), `docs/tutorials/README.md` (index; tutorials 02–05 marked planned), `DOMAIN.md` first-win section now points to the tutorial
- **Result:** The first-win command is no longer a bare one-liner; a student can complete the scan loop unassisted. Exercise 6 rehearses the attestation format; exercise 4 teaches the conformance/adequacy boundary by deliberate breakage.
- **Open issues:** Sample output numbers in Step 5 are illustrative (live fetch is blocked in this sandbox — could not capture a real success report). Tutorials 02–05 are titles only. Exercise 4's typo-provider behavior was not executed; the tutorial asks the student to discover it, but an instructor should verify the actual error message once on an unrestricted machine.

## 2026-06-12 — First honest run: BLS extract + ATS scan dry-run

- **Recipe:** manual (pre-recipe verification run under MYCROFT.md contract)
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py` against `data/bls/db-30-2-text/` + `data/bls/oesm24nat/`; `npm run ats:scan -- --dry-run` with `REALLOCATION_ENGINE_PORTALS=data/ats/portals.example.yml`
- **Outputs:** `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (1,016 occupations; SHA-256 recorded in audit), `data/bls/bls-audit.md` (962/1,016 = 94.7% matched to OEWS 2024 detailed SOC rows)
- **Result:** BLS extractor runs clean after the `Skills.txt` fix; audit generated and read; CSV schema unchanged (`skill_*` columns intact). ATS scan loaded the example portal config, matched the Greenhouse provider, ran filter/dedup/report logic, and wrote nothing in dry-run mode — machinery verified.
- **Open issues:** ATS scan's live fetch failed in the sandboxed environment (network egress blocked) — provider fetch is **not** verified end-to-end; rerun on an unrestricted machine. BLS extractor was not executed pre-fix, so "failed before fix" is inferred from the missing `Recipes.txt` file, not observed. `playwright`/`sharp` not installed; only `js-yaml`/`glob` were needed for this run.

## 2026-06-12 — Fixed rename-shrapnel bugs; added lifecycle frontmatter

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `scripts/bls/extract-soc-occupation-table.py`, `scripts/ats/analyze-patterns.py`, `scripts/ats/README.md`, 8 core recipe files
- **Outputs:** three one-line fixes (`Recipes.txt`→`Skills.txt`; `modes/RUN_LOG.md`→`logs/RUN_LOG.md` in script and README; audit prose "recipe Level scores"→"skill Level scores"); MYCROFT.md lifecycle frontmatter added to `_shared` (type: contract) and `scan`, `pipeline`, `oferta`, `tracker`, `pdf`, `patterns`, `update` (status: DRAFT, todos_open: 11 each)
- **Result:** Known defects 1–2 from DOMAIN.md closed. Recipe status is now machine-readable.
- **Open issues:** `scripts/cowork-agentic-repo.py` still contains mangled prose ("Recipes and recipes…") — cosmetic, not load-bearing. The 33 non-core recipes have no frontmatter yet.

## 2026-06-11 — Established MYCROFT.md as source of truth

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** architecture review of the full repo; Codex cross-review; Gru SDD; principles discussion (Cowork session)
- **Outputs:** `MYCROFT.md` (new — constitution v0.1.0: 8 principles, verification stack, recipe lifecycle, TODO-closure evidence, attestation format), `DOMAIN.md` (new — domain manifest: actual layout, runnable command surface, known gaps/defects), `CLAUDE.md` (rewritten as pointer to MYCROFT.md), `AGENTS.md` (rewritten as pointer; also removed "recipes, recipes" rename shrapnel)
- **Result:** One governing file; precedence rule explicit; current-vs-planned architecture separated (domain layout is current; `data/raw`/`data/verified`/snickerdoodle CLI marked roadmap). Claude Code named as v0 runtime.
- **Open issues:** Known defects listed in DOMAIN.md §Known gaps: BLS `Recipes.txt` bug, `modes/RUN_LOG.md` path bug, scorer unimplemented, no recipe has a logged run, doctor script not built, person-named recipes need privacy review, skill/recipe terminology in manuscript unreconciled. README and `docs/` not yet updated to cite MYCROFT.md.

## 2026-05-28 — Recipe folder converted to verified-data workflows

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `recipes/`, `scripts/`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`
- **Outputs:** `recipes/_shared.md`, `recipes/README.md`, active recipes, and draft/helper recipe files
- **Result:** Recipes now point students toward repo scripts, audits, and logs instead of prompt-only recipes.
- **Open issues:** Some workflows remain intentionally marked as draft until supporting scripts exist.

## 2026-05-28 — Removed copied Job-Ops source tree

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** `data/career-ops-main/`, `scripts/ats/`, `recipes/`, `resumes/`
- **Outputs:** `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `DATA_CONTRACT.md`, provider docs
- **Result:** Removed the copied reference directory after useful pieces had been adapted into maintained repo paths.
- **Open issues:** Provenance now lives in docs and adapted files, not in a local source copy.

## 2026-05-28 — Normalized data directory names

- **Recipe:** manual
- **Inputs:** old mixed-case 80 Days and BLS data directories, `data/sec/form-d/`
- **Outputs:** `data/80-days-to-stay/`, `data/bls/`, lower-kebab SEC extracted folders, updated docs/scripts
- **Result:** Source/reference data directories now use lower-case kebab-case names. Maintained automation now uses lowercase `scripts/` by repo convention.
- **Open issues:** Some source data filenames and JSON field values still preserve upstream naming.

## 2026-06-13 -- Context parity + privacy pass + doctor (consolidated; re-logged after a git reset dropped prior entries)

- **Parity:** brought this repo to the Madison/Mycroft context architecture — ported `conformance.mjs`/`to-markdown.mjs`/`build-instructions.mjs`, added `instructions/` (6 shared rule modules + `reallocation-engine.md` + manifest) compiling to generated root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, plus `.claude/` hooks (archive-guard + conformance-check) and `.github/workflows/verify.yml` (conformance + instruction drift guard). `MYCROFT.md` confirmed identical to the other Mycroft-domain repos.
- **Privacy pass (gap #6):** 14 person-named case-study recipes anonymized -> `case-*.md` role slugs; student names + Canvas submission-IDs scrubbed. Verified zero residual PII repo-wide. Git **history** also purged via `git filter-repo` (--invert-paths on the 14 old paths + --replace-text on names/IDs); force-pushed.
- **doctor (gap #5):** `scripts/doctor.mjs` (`npm run doctor`) — environment + npm-command-target + domain-dir checks + recipe-status dashboard. Surfaced gap #8: only 7/42 recipes carry lifecycle frontmatter; declared todos_open (77) vs 518 body `[TODO` markers.
- **Note:** a later `git reset`/`filter-repo` reverted edits to pre-existing tracked files (DOMAIN.md gaps reconciliation, this log, package.json scripts, generated AGENTS/CLAUDE) while new files survived; re-applied 2026-06-13. New files were unaffected.
- **Result:** doctor + conformance green; DOMAIN.md known-gaps reconciled (#1,#2,#5,#6 resolved; #3,#4,#7,#8 open).

## 2026-06-13 -- Backfill recipe lifecycle frontmatter (gap #8)

- **Commands:** One-off migration over recipes/ (excl. README + templates): prepended a `status/todos_open/last_gate/attestation/recipe_version` block to the 34 recipes that lacked one, injected the lifecycle keys into `_shared.md` (kept `type: contract`), and reconciled `todos_open` to the true `[TODO`-marker body count everywhere. 7 already-stamped recipes unchanged (idempotent).
- **Result:** doctor now reports 42/42 recipes with frontmatter, 0 missing; declared todos_open == body markers (518 = 518, mismatch gone). Conformance clean. DOMAIN gap #8 resolved.
- **Open issues:** All 42 remain `status: DRAFT` — promotion past DRAFT still requires a real gated run (gap #4) + attestation. Frontmatter is now the substrate for that lifecycle tracking.

## 2026-06-13 -- Build the Bayesian Role Scorer (gap #3)

- **Skill:** Implement the book's Chapter-11 decision core — the composite role scorer / combiner.
- **Inputs:** spec from `chapters/11-the-bayesian-role-scorer.md` (composite form, weights sponsorship 0.35 / fit 0.30, multiplicative liveness+timeline gates, threshold ~0.3, Apply/Consider/Skip, override discipline, auditability thesis) + `docs/search-profile-design.md` (weights are a function of the profile, not constants). Confirmed exact structure by reproducing the chapter's worked example backward.
- **Commands:** Wrote `scripts/score/role-scorer.mjs` — combiner only (reads per-role evidence records; does not compute components). Multiplicative gates × weighted votes; profile-conditional sponsorship weight (→0 when authorization doesn't need sponsorship); per-term audit trace with source labels (record / model-judgment / your-input); documented-override support (override without a reason is ignored, per Ch.11); JSON + Markdown report + skip-rate summary. Config block annotates every weight/threshold with provenance; role_quality weight + Consider floor left as documented `[VERIFY]` defaults (not pinned by the chapter). Built fixture `data/examples/ch11-roles.json` reproducing the chapter's two roles + gate/Consider/override cases. Wired `npm run score`.
- **Result:** Verified against the book — Cambridge biotech composite 0.446 → Apply; identical-fit non-sponsor 0.178 → Skip; ghost posting gated to 0 → Skip; Likely-tier → Consider; documented override flips Skip→Apply and records the reason. Conformance clean; doctor sees the new command. DOMAIN gap #3 resolved.
- **Open issues:** `[VERIFY]` weights (role_quality, Consider floor) need confirmation vs the system design document before real decisions. The scorer is a pure combiner — wiring the upstream feeds (Ch.7/8/9/10) to emit the per-role evidence envelope is separate (the run-envelope schema is still `[TODO: DEFINE]` in recipes/pipeline.md) and tied to the honest run (gap #4).

## 2026-06-14 -- The honest run (gap #4): first gated, logged recipe run

- **Recipe:** `oferta` (Ch.11 Bayesian role scorer), **sample mode**, run id `oferta-2026-06-14-001`.
- **Command:** `npm run score data/examples/ch11-roles.json` (stored script; no ad-hoc code).
- **Inputs:** verified fixture `data/examples/ch11-roles.json` + run-envelope (`mode: sample`).
- **Gates:** 1 Source ✓ · 2 Scope ✓ (sample) · 3 Data-shape ✓ · 4 Script-readiness ✓ · 5 Approval n/a (no live network/writes/model) · 6 Report ✓. Human adequacy gate: **PENDING attestation.**
- **Result:** 5 roles → Apply 2 · Consider 1 · Skip 2 (skip 40%). Cambridge 0.446 / non-sponsor 0.178 reproduce Ch.11. Output fully sourced (record / model-judgment / your-input).
- **Artifacts:** `logs/oferta-2026-06-14.json`, `reports/generated/oferta-2026-06-14.md`, `data/examples/role-scores.{json,md}`.
- **Flags:** skip-rate 40% < 50% (curated fixture, expected); `role_quality` weight 0 [VERIFY] drops the Ch.9 signal (gap #3); 1 documented override.
- **Open:** machine half of P4 done; **human adequacy (P4 second half) outstanding** — attest to promote `oferta` past DRAFT.

## 2026-06-14 -- Rename MYCROFT.md → SNICKERDOODLE.md (constitution rebrand)

- **Why:** disambiguate this repo's constitution from the shared **Mycroft** agent-OS frame it was forked from. Renamed to a cookie-recipe name fitting the book's "recipe" vocabulary.
- **Did:** `git mv MYCROFT.md SNICKERDOODLE.md`; rebranded the file's own identity (`# SNICKERDOODLE`, "Snickerdoodle is an agent-operating system…", lineage line preserved). Swapped every `MYCROFT.md` path/governance reference (instructions/ source, `conformance.mjs` required-files list, `manifest.yml` `@import`, CI comment, `DOMAIN.md`, `status.md`, `archive/README.md`, docs/). Rebranded this-repo "Mycroft" prose (P4, "a Snickerdoodle domain", audit doc); **kept** the cross-repo "Madison and Mycroft" shared-library mention.
- **Rebuilt:** `node scripts/build-instructions.mjs --promote` → `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` regenerated; `CLAUDE.md` now imports `@SNICKERDOODLE.md`.
- **Untouched:** `data/` CSVs (real company names containing "mycroft") and prior RUN_LOG history (append-only).
- **Result:** conformance + doctor green; no stale `MYCROFT.md` outside data/history.

## 2026-08-15 -- local-wage-adjustment: first sample run (metro OEWS × BEA RPP)

- **Recipe:** `local-wage-adjustment` (Ch 9 national-vs-local wage gap), **sample mode**, run id `local-wage-adjustment-2026-08-15-001`.
- **Commands:** `python3 scripts/bls/local-wage-adjustment.py --sample data/bls/local-wage/sample.csv --aggregate --json --output reports/generated/local-wage-adjustment-20260815.csv`, plus four break tests (Glens Falls suppression, `New Yrok`, `Ponce, PR`, off-list Austin SOC).
- **Inputs:** frozen `data/bls/local-wage/sample.csv` (112 pairs), `metro_oews.csv`, `bea_rpp.csv`, `bls_bea_msa_crosswalk.csv` (387 exact matches), `data/bls/compact/soc_occupation_compact.csv` (G4 only). Public BLS/BEA only — no `private/`, no `data/ats/`.
- **Result:** coverage **100/112** (script-output); 12 missing, reported at the time as all `suppressed-small-sample`. G4 review count 0. Mean adjusted median `124695.1482` over the 100 ok rows, missing excluded (never zero).
- **Gates:** G1/G2/G3 fail paths all observed; G4 pass path observed, no rewrites. Human adequacy signed by Atharva Kurlekar, 2026-08-15 (`logs/attestations/local-wage-adjustment.md`).
- **Artifacts:** `logs/local-wage-adjustment-20260815.json`, `reports/generated/local-wage-adjustment-20260815.{md,csv}`.
- **Open issues (closed 2026-08-16, see next entry):** the 12-row missing breakdown was wrong — G2 emitted `suppressed-small-sample` for absent OEWS rows too. This entry was appended late; the run itself is 2026-08-15.

## 2026-08-16 -- local-wage-adjustment: G2 reason-code split + corrected re-run

- **Recipe:** `local-wage-adjustment` v0.2.0, **sample mode**, run id `local-wage-adjustment-2026-08-17-001` (`run_date` cells are UTC; executed 2026-08-16 evening local).
- **Defect fixed:** `evaluate_pair` in `scripts/bls/local-wage-adjustment.py` returned `suppressed-small-sample` both for a suppression token (`*` / `**` / `#`) **and** for a `(AREA, SOC)` pair with no detailed OEWS row. Absent rows now emit the new code `no-occupation-row`. Reason codes locked in `data/BLS/local-wage-adjustment-audit.md`; recipe required-read #4 now cites that audit instead of the gitignored `Projects/target.md`.
- **Commands:** `python3 scripts/bls/local-wage-adjustment.py --sample data/bls/local-wage/sample.csv --aggregate --json --output reports/generated/local-wage-adjustment-20260817.csv`, plus five break tests including the new `no-occupation-row` fixture (`--metro "Glens Falls, NY" --soc 15-1243`).
- **Result:** coverage **100/112** unchanged; missing 12 now split **6 `suppressed-small-sample` + 6 `no-occupation-row`**. Six rows reclassified, **no wage cell changed**; mean adjusted median still `124695.1482`. G4 review count 0. New York × 15-1252 → `143892.75` unchanged.
- **Gates:** G1 ✓ fail path · G2 suppression ✓ fail path · G2 absent row ✓ fail path (new) · G3 ✓ fail path · G4 pass, 0 auto-corrects. Human adequacy signed by Atharva Kurlekar, 2026-08-16.
- **Artifacts:** `logs/local-wage-adjustment-20260817.json`, `reports/generated/local-wage-adjustment-20260817.{md,csv}`, portfolio at `assignments/submissions/atharva-kurlekar/local-wage-adjustment-portfolio.md`. The 2026-08-15 report is kept (superseded, not deleted) with a correction header.
- **Open issues:** none blocking at time of entry. Explainer video's live-terminal beat was rebuilt from a real recorded run — see `youtube/national-pay-is-not-local-pay/`. (Superseded by the 2026-08-16 entry below: that rebuild was later overwritten by a re-render.)

## 2026-08-16 -- local-wage-adjustment: contribution branch re-cut off upstream/main; video regression found

- **Why:** the contribution branch `contrib/atharva-kurlekar-local-wage-adjustment` was cut from a fork `main` that carried an unrelated personal-assignment layer. The resulting upstream PR (#43) therefore contained `search/resume.json`, `search/gaps.md`, and `search/profile.yml` — real personal contact and immigration data — in a public diff, and `npm run doctor` failed its privacy gate on `search/resume.json` from inside the contribution's own diff.
- **Did:** re-cut `contrib/local-wage-adjustment-v2` from `upstream/main` and re-applied only the contribution's files (script, recipe, card, compact BLS/BEA extracts, sample, audit, reports, logs, attestation, portfolio, `package.json` target, `scripts/doctor.mjs` card-exclusion fix). Dropped all three `search/` files and the `.gitignore` `!search/resume.json` override that had un-ignored the résumé. `logs/RUN_LOG.md` rebuilt from the upstream base plus the two local-wage entries only.
- **Not done:** `data/BLS/local-wage/metro_oews.csv` (150,176 rows) is kept whole. Filtering it to the 8 sampled SOC codes would shrink the diff by ~98%, but a later query for any unsampled `(metro, SOC)` would then return `no-occupation-row` for an occupation BLS actually publishes — a fabricated miss. Reviewability loses to correctness; the file is an 11-column compact extract of the federal OEWS metro release, not a raw dump.
- **Defect found (explainer video):** the delivered film at `youtube/national-pay-is-not-local-pay/mp4/national-pay-is-not-local-pay.mp4` had regressed. A re-render against a new voiceover dropped the spliced real terminal recording and restored the earlier Manim-drawn terminal — including a truncated line no program printed — reducing the segment from 44.79s (two real commands) to 8.15s (one drawn one). `live/take.cast` was never re-spliced. Measured: 258.69s film, silence only 182.14–190.29s, video stream 254.54s vs audio 258.69s.
- **Result:** clean branch carries no `private/`, no `data/ats/`, and no `search/` personal data. `npm run doctor` privacy gate passes on this branch (`✓ no private/PII paths are tracked`); `npm run verify` conforms (138 files). Coverage re-reproduced on the clean branch: `100/112`, mean `124695.1482`, all four gate fail paths observed.
- **Film not rebuilt (decision, not oversight).** Re-splicing `live/take.cast` was scoped and costed — insert at the fade boundary (frames 4293–4476), which also carries runtime to ~5:03 and clears the 5:00 floor — then **declined for now**. Instead, every document that described the film was corrected to describe the cut that actually ships: the portfolio's demo line and a new "About the demo footage" section, the requirements table in `youtube/.../script-v3.md` (which had marked runtime "Pass" against a superseded 3–6 min rubric), and the header of `youtube/.../terminal-transcript-live-demo.md`. The claim "44.8s uncut recording" appeared in the portfolio and was false as written; it is gone.
- **Open issues:** the delivered film does not meet the assignment's graded core — it is 4:19 against a 5–6 min requirement, and its terminal segment is a drawn reconstruction rather than a live capture. The real capture (`live/take.cast`, 44.79s, both commands) is committed and unused. Recorded here rather than left to be discovered.
